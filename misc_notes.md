## Installing R under macOS

### Without Xcode

If you have no Xcode installed and you do not want to install Xcode, you solely rely on the binary versions of the packages built by CRAN. (This might go well on your machine or not.)

In this case, _always deny_ building packages from source when asked during installation or updating.

### With Xcode

To work properly on your machine, some packages will need compilation from the source code. To do so, you need to install Xcode command-line tools. 

It is imperative that you re-run the following command _everytime_ Xcode updates in Terminal (not in the R console).

``` sh
xcode-select --install
```

**For R 3.4.0 to 3.6.0.** To use `data.table`â€™s parallel processing capability, you will need a version of OpenMP to be installed on your machine. Consider to follow the instructions on [https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Installation#openmp-enabled-compiler-for-mac). This is optional.

**For R 3.6.1.** This release uses Clang 7.0.0 and GNU Fortran 6.1, neither of which is supplied by Apple. Make sure you install these [tools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/) first. This affects _all packages_ and is mandatory.
