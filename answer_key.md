Certainly, there’s more than one way to skin a cat. This is one set of
suggested answers.

## [Introductory Part 2](part_02-data_structures.md)

1.  Which data type is the vector `c("Tagesgericht" = 1.60, "Menü 1"
    = 2.00, "Menü 2" = 2.50, "Aktionsteller" = 3.50)`?
    
    It’s a named numeric vector of type `double`, i.e. floating point
    numbers.

2.  Can you assign this vector to the variable `prizes_students`? How
    could you access the costs for “Menü
    2”?
    
    ``` r
    prizes_students <- c("Tagesgericht" = 1.60, "Menü 1" = 2.00, "Menü 2" = 2.50, "Aktionsteller" = 3.50)
    prizes_students["Menü 2"]
    ```
    
        ## Menü 2 
        ##    2.5

3.  Which menus cost more than two euros?
    
    ``` r
    prizes_students[prizes_students > 2]
    ```
    
        ##        Menü 2 Aktionsteller 
        ##           2.5           3.5

4.  Your colleagues order twice the “Tagesgericht”, three times “Menü
    1”, three times “Menü 2”, and once “Aktionsteller”. The boss pays.
    How much does he or she need to pay?
    
    ``` r
    sum(prizes_students * c(2, 3, 3, 1))
    ```
    
        ## [1] 20.2

5.  The canteen wants to increase the prizes by 50 cents. Calculate the
    new prizes\!
    
    ``` r
    prizes_students + 0.5
    ```
    
        ##  Tagesgericht        Menü 1        Menü 2 Aktionsteller 
        ##           2.1           2.5           3.0           4.0

6.  The prizes of the menus for employees are
    `c(3.10, 3.50, 4.00, 5.00)` respectively. Create a new vector called
    `prizes_employees` and assign the names of `prizes_students` to the
    names of this vector.
    
    ``` r
    prizes_employees <- c(3.10, 3.50, 4.00, 5.00)
    names(prizes_employees) <- names(prizes_students)
    prizes_employees
    ```
    
        ##  Tagesgericht        Menü 1        Menü 2 Aktionsteller 
        ##           3.1           3.5           4.0           5.0

7.  Let’s make a list containing both vectors called `prizes`. If you
    want, you can include the prizes for guests, which are 50 cents
    higher than the costs for employees. Apply the rise in prices to all
    groups\!
    
    ``` r
    prizes <- list(students = prizes_students, employees = prizes_employees, guests = prizes_employees + 0.5)
    prizes
    ```
    
        ## $students
        ##  Tagesgericht        Menü 1        Menü 2 Aktionsteller 
        ##           1.6           2.0           2.5           3.5 
        ## 
        ## $employees
        ##  Tagesgericht        Menü 1        Menü 2 Aktionsteller 
        ##           3.1           3.5           4.0           5.0 
        ## 
        ## $guests
        ##  Tagesgericht        Menü 1        Menü 2 Aktionsteller 
        ##           3.6           4.0           4.5           5.5
    
    ``` r
    lapply(prizes, function(x) x + 0.5)
    ```
    
        ## $students
        ##  Tagesgericht        Menü 1        Menü 2 Aktionsteller 
        ##           2.1           2.5           3.0           4.0 
        ## 
        ## $employees
        ##  Tagesgericht        Menü 1        Menü 2 Aktionsteller 
        ##           3.6           4.0           4.5           5.5 
        ## 
        ## $guests
        ##  Tagesgericht        Menü 1        Menü 2 Aktionsteller 
        ##           4.1           4.5           5.0           6.0

## [Introductory Part 3](part_03-working_with_strings.md)

1.  What is the result of `strsplit(paste0("AG", "CGT", "A", "TGCT"),
    "GC")`?
    
    It’s a list containing a `character` vector of length three. One of
    the two breaking points is generated by pasting the four strings
    together. Note that the breaking points are removed.
    
        ## [[1]]
        ## [1] "A"    "GTAT" "T"

2.  Suppose you have the vector `c("ÁlM", "AnJ", "DaS", "DmS", "JaW",
    "ShP", "SuB")`. Using regular expressions, how do you identify all
    words that contain
    
    1.  the lowercase ‘a’,
        
        ``` r
        x <- c("ÁlM", "AnJ", "DaS", "DmS", "JaW", "ShP", "SuB")
        
        x[stringr::str_detect(x, "a")]
        ```
        
            ## [1] "DaS" "JaW"
    
    2.  ‘a’ or ‘A’,
        
        ``` r
        x[stringr::str_detect(x, "[Aa]")]
        ```
        
            ## [1] "AnJ" "DaS" "JaW"
    
    3.  any non-Latin character,
        
        ``` r
        x[stringr::str_detect(x, "[^A-Za-z]")]
        ```
        
            ## [1] "ÁlM"
    
    4.  more than two consonants in a row,
        
        ``` r
        x[stringr::str_detect(x, "[^AEIOUaeiou]{3,}")]
        ```
        
            ## [1] "ÁlM" "DmS" "ShP"
    
    5.  end (or start) with ‘S’?
        
        ``` r
        x[stringr::str_detect(x, "^S")]
        ```
        
            ## [1] "ShP" "SuB"
        
        ``` r
        x[stringr::str_detect(x, "S$")]        
        ```
        
            ## [1] "DaS" "DmS"
